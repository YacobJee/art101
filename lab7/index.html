					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>Create a function that takes a user's name and sorts it, then returns the new sorted name.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>Not many problems arose, as I didn't put myself too much out there this time. I'm aware that capitals and lowers are sorted differently, so I made 
                        the function lowercase everything. However, I wasn't sure how to adress uppercasing that specific letter again in the sorted list, so i left it alone and just let it lowercase
                        everything. This doesn't account for names with all caps, however, but at least everything is sorted somewhat.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I mostly went into this assignment hoping t get it done, and try some things out. That's why I at least put in the lowercase method, though I wish I did more.
                        I didn't exactly address the problems of differentiating between upper and lowercase, and just opted to lower everything and call it a day.

                    </p>
