			<h1>Lab 3 - File Structure & File Transfer</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>Create a local, organized file structure, add index.html files, and upload it to the server</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>There weren't many problems, aside from self imposed ones in trying to go beyond and make the homepage more to my style. Eventually they were either resolved or
						the ideas were abandoned in favor of completeness. Additionally, the simpleness minimized partner work.
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>This lab went incredibly smoothly, mostly because the lab was already completed in the template. There were some things added, but i personally didn't put a lot of effort into 
						making astonishing changes or demonstrated exceptional work, but at least I now understand how iterating through files works. It'll come in handy when coding concepts like loops and
						recursion come into play. </p>
