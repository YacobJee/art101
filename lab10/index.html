					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>Work with Javascript Events to either sort an inputted name or make an anagram.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>The only problems I had was trying to figure out how to make an anagram, which confused me when I looked it up. Honestly if I tried to reverse it with a for loop, 
						I could probably do it, or imported public classes as stackoverflow told me to do so to create a reverse() function. However, it confused me, so I didn't do so. 
						Perhaps if I learn more about for loops in javascript compared to python, I might be able to do this assignment again.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>Since Wes mainly posted all of the code for this assignment, I wanted to come in and try to make an anagram funciton myself. 
						However, I quicky gave up when I got confused and wasn't sure if I was allowed to use public classes or for loops and the like. 
						Honestly I could probably do it by applying myselfa bt more, but at least I tried to make an anagram. </p>

						<h1 id="hello-world">Hello World!</h1>
