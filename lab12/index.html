			<h1>Lab 12 - Conditionals</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>Work with conditionals to create a Sorting Hat function that sorts inputted names into Hogwarts Houses based on the length of the name.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>Not many problems shwoed up, everything went pretty smoothly. Trying to add jquery in messed it up, most likely since having the .value is something different in jquery language.</p> 
					<p>After understanding how pure javascript is affected and formatted by jquery, I went back and replaced the raw html with jquery, shortening the overall process and simplifying it.
						The main problemlies in the fact that I didn't know how value was cahnged, as in jquery it's written as val(). Going back and changing the whole thing allowed the function to still
						work, and allowed a simpler reading when reviewed. 
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>This assignment went far more smoothly compared to the last one, most likely since I chose to not use jquery. 
						There's also the fact that conditionals are something familiar, even if the format is a bit different than python's. 
						Adding descriptions was also pretty simple, with the use of a second function making things pretty easy to add. </p>

					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>Please enter your name for sorting.</p>
