					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>Work with javascript arrays and objects, while also printing them out.</p>

					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>Aside from basic syntax errors while working in chrome, there was some confusion on how to print out objects neatly. Before seeing the step 
						(and not knowing how to stringify at first), I tried to just havce it print in console as is, resulting in [object Object]. Apparently, that's normal, since
						printing objects is a bit troublesome. I resorted to simply hardcoding a shaky sentence, before seeing the next step.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I came in here still a bit confused about java, doubly so when I found there were a bunch of functions and shortcuts I could use like scriptify. I wanted to 
						truly get my footing with this assignment, and I think I'm starting to get it. At least with this, I think searching the internet for those extra tags
						will help a lot.</p>
