					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>There were a lot of formatting issues, cases where I'd make typos or wouldn't understand how to format both jQuery and CSS.
						I tried to give the result buttons seperate colors that would change like they do now,
						but for whatever reason assigning them speciifc colors outside of the default css i gave all buttons 
						would completely break the functions, and I couldn't get the toggleClass to work at all. I have absolutely no idea why that's the case,
						and simply removing the id CSS allowed it to work.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section" id="reflection">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I'm honestly really frustrated at jQuery, but that's my own fault. I can see how it works now, and how it makes javascript so much easier.
						Perhaps because everything got simplified it's now a little foreign to me, and that's porobably the cause of most of my issues now.
						I think with time I should be able to adjust and hopefully not make the same nmistakes this time. </p>
