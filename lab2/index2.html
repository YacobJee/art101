            <h1>Hello World!</h1>

            <p>My name is Jacob, from Merrill. I'm an artist and a writer who prefers to sleep like a log whenever I'm not doing either of the two. 
                I'd like to make a living of either of those two hobbies, so being in the AGPM major I'd like to design my own videogame myself some day.</p>
            <p>Here's an example of what I like to do!</p>
            <img src="./img/Struggle.jpg" width="700">
            <p>My partner is Brandon Vindel. He describes himself as an introvert who likes to spend time indoors, with a love of video games to the point of always losing track of time. 
                He prefers mainly sports games but also likes FPS, platformers, and racing games. He also enjoys music and art, and cooking is a calming activity. 
                Apparently he has a dream of becoming a chef one day as well as a videogame designer, and if neither of those is in the cards he wouldn't mind being a stay-at-home dad. 
                Despite being introverted (similar to me), he’s a really friendly person who can get along with anyone and always prioritizes others’ happiness before his own. He’s a pretty good guy!</p>
