			<h1>Lab 2 - HTML & CSS Starter</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>With a partner, create a basic HTML and CSS style file, editing and inspecting it according to guidelines.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>Some misunderstandings happened while coding, as the use of shortcuts tripped up the process. 
						Additionally, there were some difficulties in the CSS, only due to lack of familiarity. No # was placed in front of content, as I thought it would make it into a comment like in python. 
						Task X was also difficult to complete as there needed to be changes to the indexes to link together the multiple labs, which wasn't done in advance. THerefore some searching was
						needed to be done in order to learn how to link to other html files in the same repository.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>For my first taste of html in a long time, I honestly had a lot of fun with this. There were difficulties, but I'm glad I was able to work through them, 
						and that my partner also helped me when there were some issues, and vice versa. I'm honestly curious as for what's to come, as while I didn't do a lot CSS-wise,
						I want to see what I can do with more complicated things and when actual coding is involved.</p>
