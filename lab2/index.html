			<h1>Lab 2 - HTML & CSS Starter</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>With a partner, create a basic HTML and CSS style file, editing and inspecting it according to guidelines.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>Some misunderstandings happened while coding, as the use of shortcuts tripped up the process. 
						Additionally, there were some difficulties in the CSS, only due to lack of familiarity. No # was placed in front of content, as I thought it would make it into a comment like in python. 
						Task X was also difficult to complete as there needed to be changes to the indexes to link together the multiple labs, which wasn't done in advance. THerefore some searching was
						needed to be done in order to learn how to link to other html files in the same repository.</p>
